# README

This is the final project for the Ruby on Rails course provided by The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).

It is an app designed to mimick the functionality of facebook in certain ways, such as news feeds, posting, commenting, liking, and friending. You can use facebook to log into it. It has email activations.

Pictures (other than gravatar) coming soon (maybe).
