# README

This is the final project for the Ruby on Rails course provided by The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).

It is meant to mimick the back-end functionality of the site facebook, most importantly how the relational database has been set up. I used postgresql in both development and production, and I used devise for authentications. I also incorporated Bulma CSS as the CSS framework to show my fanboy pride in my favorite show franchise, Dragon Ball.
